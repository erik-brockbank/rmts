24,Explanation,3/16/14,10/21/07,Because it makes a tree house,Doy? ,Because over here (points at standard),Doy? (,Because it looks like a microphone,Because it makes…,Because it makes a…,Because it makes …together and …,Because there's a blanket,Because it has a rainbow on it,Because it makes a horse,Because it makes a toy
25,Explanation,3/29/14,12/28/08,"In this card, these two go together, and this two go together","Because this one (the correct card) goes with this one, and this one (standard) goes with this one, but the this card (object match) does not","Because these shapes match, and these two match","Because these two match, and these two match",Because these are two shapes and these are two shapes,"These two are matching shapes, these two are matching shapes, and these two are not matching shapes","These two match, and these two match","Because these two shapes match, and these two match, and these two don't","Because these are two of the same shapes, and these are two of the same shapes","Because these two are round, and these two are two rainbow shapes","Because these two match, and these two match","Because these two match, and these 2 match"
27,Explanation,3/29/14,6/1/07,"Because these two don't go together, but these two are the same and these two are the same.","These two aren't the same shapes, but these two are both diamonds and these two are ovals","Because that one and that one are the same shapes (Relational), and these two are different shapes(object) and that one and that one are the same shapes (standard)","These two shapes are the same and these two shapes are the same, and these two match and these two match, but these two don't.","Because those two are the same and those two are the same although they're different shapes from that one, but these ones, they're two different shapes",Because these ones are different ones and these two match and these are the same shapes,"Because these ones are the same shapes and these are the same shapes, but the shapes are different from each other (standard vs. relational)",Because these are different shapes from this one but there's two of them,"Because these are two of the same shapes, and these shapes are different from that, but there's two of them and two of those","Because that card, the shapes are the same and these are still different shapes but these look the same and these look the same","Because they're the same shapes as each other, and there's two of them, and these big ones are different shapes [from the first card] but there's two of them","Because those ones are the same, they're the same shapes, and those are the same shapes and there's two of them"
28,Explanation,3/29/14,8/29/08,Because these two are circles,Because they're both kind of out to the side,Because they each have the same shapes,Because they're both the same shapes and they're in a straight line,They're both tall,Because they're both out to the side,Because they're in a straight line and they're both out to the side,Because that one's pointy and that one's pointy( comparing standard and relational ),Because they both have flat sides ( comparing standard and relational),Because they both have a [draw with finger a slope shape],Because this one is pointy and that one,Because some of them have flat sides
29,Explanation,3/29/14,2/9/09,No Answer,"This (relational card) goes on top of that(standard card) - not referring to the two shapes on one card, but rather one card on top of another card",Because that goes on that (standard goes on relational),Because this one goes on top of that,Because this one goes on top of that,Because this and this (referring to pointy ends of the shapes of the two cards),Because of that (referring to the same object on the cards),Because this goes on top of that,Because this (the slope of the shape of relational card) and that (points at side of standard card shape),Because this can go on top of that,Because this can go on top of that,Because this fits in there (the triangle of the standard card can fit into the pacman shape of the object card)
30,Explanation,3/29/14,9/26/08,Because you can see the square on both cards (referring to the piece of paper on which the shapes are printed on),Because this can go like this (putting the relational card on top of the standard card),Because this goes with this (Referring to common shape),Because this and this (pointing at common shape),When you put this right here (put relational on standard) it makes the same,Points to side of shape,Because it has the same shape as this one,Because it has the same shape as this,Because of this shape (points to slope of shape),Because this has a swivel and this has a swivel,Because it has the same shape as this one,Because it has a triangle
49,Explanation,5/2/14,3/13/08,they both have two things that are the same,"(Standard card) has 2 thing like (Relational), it's the same thing",Because it has the same thing ( compare the same shap found in standard and O card),Because it has the same thing ( compare the same shap found in standard and O card),"Because this is two and this is two, they are both the same thing ( R & S)This one, there's 2 but that's a different thing than those","Because this is two and this is two, they are both the same thing ( R & S)This one, there's 2 but that's a different thing than those",because they have the same thing ( R & S),because they have the same thing ( R & S),They are both 2 of the same thing,silent?,because they have the same thing ( R & S),because they have the same thing ( R & S)
50,Explanation,5/2/14,10/11/08,Because circles fit in squares,These (standard) card go with these (relational),Because they're both the same ( O & S ),This one (sextagon shape) goes with this one (standard),They both match up the edges,Thinking that this end (relational) fits with these (standard),This one (diamond) is to the side of this one if you turn this card on side it fits,Circle goes around this one (relational),Cause they match up the edge,There's a circle around this card,Want to pick both. It matches up the edges,It's the same one
52,Explanation,5/2/14,3/14/08,"Because there's 2 that are both the same: circle and circle, square and sqaure",Same thing,There's 2 and 2 that are actually the same,Same thing,Same thing,Same thing,Cause they are 2 of the same,Both the same. They're 2 and 2,This one is 2 that has the same and this one is 2 that has the same,Same,because it's the same Same,Same thing
54,Explanation,5/2/14,6/26/07,They (R) don't have a different picture like this (o),They don't have different things up above. They have the same thing,They have the same bottoms,They have the same toys,They're both thin,"No, I was thinking the other one goes. So, I guess it's because They both have points",Both have 4 edges,They both have 1 edge,They both have (diagonal edge),Both are scribbles,Both have 4 edges,This has a triangle fitting here (pacman) and it has a triangle
